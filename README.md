K-Nearest Neighbors
The KNN is one of the simplest classifier supervised machine learning algorithm. Instead of training a model, KNN will predict the class of an observation by using the K features close to the observation using some metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski. Then the K features vote based on their classs and a class with majority of votes wins. 

It should be noted that the features should be standardized in order to get the best result.

We use Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set for our practice
